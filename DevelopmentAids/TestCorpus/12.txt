Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted to CCU after emergency cardiac cath/IABP placement.
Pre-op w/u completed and taken to the OR directly for surgery
with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. Transferred to the CVICU in stable condition on
titrated phenylephrine and propofol drips.  The patient was
loaded with Plavix pre-cath, on the day of surgery.  Out of the
OR, he was coagulopathic, requiring multiple blood products.
Hemodynamics improved and vasoactive drips were weaned by POD 1.
 The IABP was weaned and discontinued on POD 2. The patient was
aggressively diuresed and extubated on POD 3.  Beta blocker was
initiated and titrated as tolerated.  The patient was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest
tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  Norvasc and Lisinopril
were added for hypertension.  The patient has poor targets, and
Plavix was initiated.  By the time of discharge on POD 5 the
patient was ambulating with assistance, the wound was healing
and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was
discharged to [**Location (un) 167**] Center of [**Location (un) 55**] in good
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
